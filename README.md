# zarc

A pretty darn good implementation of various archive formats (`zip` and `tar` at the moment) in Zig. Originally created for use within [jaz](https://github.com/SuperAuguste/jaz).

## Attribution

* The `tar` header struct in `tar.zig` was taken directly from `mattnite`'s awesome [`mattnite/tar`](https://github.com/mattnite/tar) library. Kudos to him!
